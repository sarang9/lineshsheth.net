<p>I have known Avinash Sharma since his childhood, as he happens to be my daughter's son. I remember, right from early childhood we have liked each other. I saw future in him whereas he saw a teacher and a guide in me. He saw my reflection in his mother Nisha, who followed the teachings of the Humanist Movement practically in daily life. So he also saw his mother as a reference.</p>
<div class="col-lg-3" style="margin:10px 10px; padding:0px;">

<p>Avinash says, the period until he did his matriculation was governed by his drives and instincts, not necessarily by what is good for his life. In that, he generally followed the trend that was prevailing among youth of his age. He was no longer told by tradition and values about what he should do, nor he was knowing what basically he wishes to do. Largely he followed what other people do or what other people wished him to do. There was no independent thinking of his own.</p>

<p> It was during his college days of pursuing graduation, he increasingly became conscious that the life needs to have a direction. He felt that external pursuit of goals are necessary in life, but balance in life is created only when internally he begins to understand how to transform himself from being static to dynamic, from being stagnant to moving towards energy. </p>

<div class="col-lg-2" style="margin:10px 10px; padding:0px;">
<img src="../images/we-name1.jpg" class="img-responsive">
</div>

<p> It was at the point that he came in touch with me seriously. I introduced him to various methods of SOIL (School of Internal Literacy) in increasing the energy, circulating it, directing and focusing it where one wants. </p>
 
<p>Avinash, by nature, is honest truthful, grasping and implementing man. He liked the sensation that these practices created in terms of feeling and movement of breath, in experiencing the energy flow and consequent sensation of blood flow in the parts he concentrated upon. He liked the Soil's approach of the system of moving from complexity of energy flow to the simplicity of its realization. More or less, these methods found their practical application in daily life, during discussions at family level, during work, and during association with his friends. </p>

<img src="../images/energy1.jpg" class="img-responsive">
</div>
<p>Avinash recalls the core understanding of Soil which said, mental states are governed by the balance or imbalance of energy flow, not merely by process of thinking. Remembering this, he was able to overcome his low periods of life, which are common with most young people, by boosting and balancing his energy through breathing, stretching and visualizing the bright future. Avinash learnt well the <b>Principles of Energization, Principles of Breathing, Principles of Energy Loss(Entropy and ageing), Principles of Image</b> and its influence on daily life. All these principles are mentioned here as a separate text.</p>



<p>Avinash says he was largely influenced by the tenets let down by Silo that said, "Image precedes action". Therefore as large or small is one's image, so is the size of his action. He learnt the whole characteristic of the imaging system as illustrated practically by Silo in his book "Guided Experiences". He learnt from me the tenets of images which are mentioned in a separate page here.</p>

<p>Avinash basically is studious and intelligent. With great perseverance and attention he completed his CFA. He is also a sports person, deeply interested in playing football, interested in cricket, gymnasium and fitness. Therefore discipline, regularity and adherence to what is of value in life, family or in work, go together with him as a character.</p>

<p>Avinash is a deeply thinking man. He is quiet, tolerant and contemplative. He says, basically he is convinced that acquiring skill to master the images, mastering the whole system of visualization as also exercises to move, circulate and focus energy are the basis of personal development. </p>
<div class="col-lg-5" style="margin:10px 10px; padding:0px;">
<img src="../images/mean.jpg" class="img-responsive">
</div>
<p>He understands that meaning of life lies in learning from experiencing and in giving to the society the essence of what he has gained. He considers this as a humanist approach to life.</p>

<p>Avinash says, it was very interesting experience to learn that energy can be increased in the body and mind, it can be transferred to any organ, it can be balanced focused and it can be expanded through breathing, stretching and visualization. </p>

<p> In this moment he uses these techniques during his daily train travel, during his work and in those moments he feels low, in order to regain his normalcy. However he is keen to set apart exclusive daily sessions to work on images, visualization and energization. He is conscious in creating an attitude to spread goodness harmony and development to others.</p>

<p>Talking about a particular aspect of his character building, he told me that he is gradually able to form an image of what he is and what he is not. That image of what he wants to be, guides him to reject and not to associate with anything that does not tally with that image he has built for himself. That is his guide, his internal reference, for what is valid for him to adopt and accept in life. </p>

<p>Living constantly with Avinash has been a great pleasure. He has great respect for my wife Lina with whom he unfailingly participates in what is encouraging in life.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p> The air in the atmosphere becomes
    our breath when it touches our
    body. Then it is no longer air, it
    becomes our living agent, a cause
    for Life in us to survive.</p></li>

<li><p>We can think of breath as a
    substance or as 'someone' we are
    lovingly related to. However If we
    treat it as a substance, it becomes
    just our living agent for survival.</p>

    <p>If we treat it as 'someone' we are
    vitally related to, it transforms into
    a  healing agent that completely
    changes our way of living.</p>

    <p>The way we think changes quality of
    the way we breathe. If we think
    breath is a substance,  we become
    a consumer of breath or if we think
    breath is what we are closely related
    to,  we become a lover of life who
    smiles as he breathes.</p></li>

<li><p>Our body is not a lump of flesh and
    bones. It is a great web of networks.
    And our breath is a virtual substance
    that carries oxygen to all these
    networks of organs, muscles, bones
    and nerves in the body.</p></li>

<li><p>Oxygen produces energy in the
    body networks. 
    Energy in use is called kinetic energy
    Energy that is stored for future use
    is called potential energy.</p></li>

<li><p>Oxygenation of an area in the body
    creates Energization in that region
    and in that network.</p></li>

<li><p>Normal breathing gives us just
    enough energy for body to survive
    and mind to overcome routine
    difficulties of life. That quantity of
    energy is not enough for body and
    mind to excel in life without causing
    undue stress.</p>

    <p>For one to excel, he needs not only
    far more energy but also its balance
    and rhythm. If the brain becomes the
    focus of balance and rhythm of
    energy, it greatly affects one's
    mental capabilities.</p></li>

<li><p>The entire atmosphere around us
    contains huge abundance of energy
    in form of oxygen which one can
    draw in through disciplined breathing
    or remain at ordinary level through
    normal breathing patterns.</p></li>

<li><p>Newton’s hypothesis states as follows:
  “Every particle of matter in the universe
   attracts every other particle with a force
   that varies directly as the product of the
   masses and inversely as the square of the
    distance”.</p>

  <p>If we breathe in deeply and consciously as
  if we are attracting energy, order and
  balance from the universe, they will
  eventually become integral part of our
  character as we repeat the practice daily.</p></li>


<li><p>There are particular ways by which
    breath can be directed, focused,  
    spread, circulated,  rotated
    as ascending or descending
    spirals, expanded or contracted,
    centered or concentrated. Each of
    these aspects is achieved by
    following a particular way of
    breathing. Each way of breathing
    has a varying effects on the body
    and its organs.</p></li>
    
<li><p>Energization is directly proportional
    to frequency, volume, attention and
    staying period of breath in an area
    of the body.</p>

    <p>Frequency refers to number of times
    we breathe, volume refers to fullness
    of breath and attention refers to
    single pointedness of mind with
    which we breathe.</p></li>

<li><p>Breath follows the posture the body
    takes. We can direct the flow of
    breath, or the flow of the energy, at
    any region we want by modulating
    our posture.</p></li>

<li><p>Energy flows where attention goes.</p></li>

<li><p>Blood flows where energy goes.</p></li>

<li><p>Strength flows where blood goes.</p></li>

<li><p>Robustness flows where
       strength.</p></li>

<li><p>The way we always think about
      breath, changes the quality of our
      breathing. A casual or isolated way
      of thinking, at best,  produces only
      mild changes. .It does not bring
      about  lasting changes in life.</p>

      <p>To produce a change that really
      matters in life,  thoughts have to
      be uniform and are to repeated
      regularly to create a conducive
      mental environment.</p>

      <p>Such repetitive thoughts create a 
      very helpful thought pattern.
      And it is not so much our thought
      but the patterns of our thought
      that make a psychological
      difference to our life.</p></li>

<li><p>Our breathing patterns produces
      an energy patterns within our body
      and brain.</p>

      <p>The energy patterns make 
      energetic difference to the
      way  we live. The change of
      energy pattern  into the body :</p></li>

<li><p>However, the change of energy
     pattern into the body :</p>

    <p>● produces change in metabolism</p>

    <p>● creates resistance to diseases.</p>

    <p>● strengthens the organ at which

<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">

<li><p>Breath is virtual substance that
   carries oxygen.</p></li>

<li><p>Oxygen produces energy in the body.
   Energy in use is called kinetic
   energy.Energy that is stored to be
   used is called potential energy.</p></li>

<li><p>Oxygenation of an area in the body 
   creates Energization in that region.</p></li>

<li><p>Energy flows from  what you are  
  connected to  seamlessly. Abundance
  and strength of your connecting
  source determines the  quantity and
  quality of  energy you will receive .</p></li>

<li><p>Flow of energy through breath
   follows your visualization. If you
   visualize that you are breathing in
   for improving your health, your  
   breath will circulate in the body to
    improve your health.</p>

    <p>If you visualize that your breath
    carries energy flow  from the earth,
    and allow it to move beyond your
    brain to merge with the cosmos, you
    will feel a big change in volume of
    your breath and your energy level.</p></li>

<li><p>Breath can be directed,
    spread, circulated, expanded,
    contracted, centred & concentrated.</p></li>

<li><p>A very important feature of breath
    manoeuvre is that it can be spiraled.
    Spiraling gives a new dimension to
    the breath.</p></li>

<li><p>A specially important feature of
    breathing is that it can be associated
    with a thought, feeling, images,
    visualizations and prayers both while
    breathing in and breathing out as a
    way of affirmation.</p></li>

<li><p>For example, breathing in you
    visualize and ask for fulfillment what
    you need, breathing out, you visualize
    receiving what you asked. Breathing
    in, you resolve, breathing out you
    fulfill your resolution. Breathing in,
    you pray and visualize for someone's
     well being, breathing out, you
    visualize your prayers are being
    answered.</p></li>

<li><p>Energization is directly proportional
     to frequency, volume, attention and
    staying period of breath in an area
    of the body.</p>

   <p>• Frequency refers to number of
     times we breathe,</p>

   <p>• volume refers to fullness of breath
     and</p>

   <p>• attention refers to single
     pointedness of mind.</p></li>

<li><p>Breath follows the contour of the
    posture body takes. It means,
    We can direct the flow of
    breath, or the flow of the energy, at
    any region we want by modulating
    the contour of our posture.</p></li>
   
<li><p>The contour of the posture  can be
    circular, elliptical, orbital, cross
    winding, straight, bent or shaped in
    a particular way.The breath will
    follow the contour as you direct it.
    If the contour is dynamic or
    rhythmically moving, the breath will
    follow the path of the movement of
    contour.</p></li>

<li><p>Since breath is another name for
     life force, and energy, you will
     energize or enliven the organ or a
     body region where you will direct
     the breath by maneuvering your
     posture. Know that flow of energy
    follows the breath</p></li>

<li><p>This forms a great understanding
     about energization.</p></li>
   
<li><p>Energy flows where attention
       goes.</p></li>

<li><p>Blood flows where energy goes.</p></li>

<li><p>Strength flows where blood goes.</p></li>

<li><p>Robustness is built where strength
      is  accumulated.</p></li>

<li><p>A casual or isolated thought, at
     best,  produces a mild action.It does
     not bring about lasting changes in
     life.</p></li>

<li><p>To produce a change that really
     matters in life,  thoughts have to be
     uniform and are to repeated
     regularly to create a conducive
     mental environment. You can repeat
     the thoughts with every breath.</p>

     <p>Such repetitive thoughts create a
     very helpful thought pattern. And it
     is the  thinking patterns we
     consciously  create that makes
     psychological  difference to our life.</p></li>

<li><p>Our breathing pattern makes
      energetic difference to the way we
      live. </p></li>

<li><p>However, the change of energy
     pattern into the body :</p>

    <p>● produces change in metabolism</p>

    <p>● creates resistance to diseases.</p>

    <p>● strengthens the organ at which
       energy is directed.</p>

    <p>● changes our exuberance in daily
       life.</p></li>
