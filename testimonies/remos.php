<p><b>11.11.2020</b></p>

<p>I am Remo Solari of Stark Italy. Getting to know Soil meditation has been for me quite interesting and precious</p>

<p>I started to exercise with a little of skepticism since at the beginning I was not feeling much but I kept my mind free and open and little by little along with the different exercises I started to feel better and in harmony

Along with practicing exercises became more precise and together with this I started to feel more relaxed and silent inside.</p>


<p>Moreover I could feel the energy throughout my body.

I'm sure with the more practice I be able to tune better the good feelings in my body and I will definitely keep on practicing.</p>

<p>Meditation also helped my awareness and although it is very difficult for me to express it in words all what I feel during my excercises....I simply feel much better in my body and my mind.



Two exercises in particular,</p>

<p>1 the breathing marathon and have been very demanding but</p>

<p>2 the breathing super marathon

very rewarding

Rewarding because it seems it activates your blood circulation.</p>

<p>After the breathing marathon.! rested in standing position feeling the energy floating all

over my body

Particular feature worth mentioning is that my brain felt quite bright




Then after a little rest, I started the exercise once again. Heart beat was constant but seemed a little higher while I lost the sense of the space.

While doing both exercises my mind was thoughts free.

Then I rested in sleeping position and my body I was feeling tickling all over my body

My heart was beating faster but slowed down quite fast.

My mind very bright and full of energy</p>




<p>The feeling I had is that the breathing marathon gives you a lot of energy but the Super Marathon(270+270 Rhythmic breaths) is a kind of further booster.</p>

<p>• No matter the physical effort | did not feel tired at all. On the contrary my body was very much stimulated and full of power.</p>

<p>COSMIC MEDITATION</p>

<p>Then I started cosmic meditation



with 2 exercises.

These calmed my body...I felt peaceful inside and thoughts free.

I was able to focus only at the "precision" of the exercise, caring about breathing properly and relaxing

When exercises were done I was feeling very well in good spirit and quite relaxed.

It has been a great experience then I




try to repeat everyday</p>

<p>Starting the day with these exercises gave me the opportunity to look inside myself and adjust the pace of my life so that I will try to be as consistent as possible.

At last it has been simply a new great experience and need to than Linesh for his patience and his efforts.</p>
