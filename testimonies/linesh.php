<p>LINESH SHETH Member HUMANIST MOVEMENT </p>

<p>A Testimony of my Involvement

and Process </p>

<p>This recount of the year 1976, more than 40 years almost to the day of this memoir, I was running a small business being a Mechanical Engineer. At that moment in time, in my mid 30's, with a family to support, for me, then, carving daily bread and setting the basic aspects of living were central to my life. I had a wife, two children, aged parents and an extended family to care about</p>

<p>Yet, for me, forever a seeker oft meaning.

ing fueling pervaded, and after

hearing Osha, I was captivated that ife

must have a dimension beyand just

surviving that I was as yet unaware of</p>

<p>It was then, in the same year 1976, that

came across this message of Silo,through

The Community for Human

Development. Its volunteer, an

Argentinian, Pablo Vergara, declared

Life has a Meaning. He further said,

"knowing one's inner self helps

overcome suffering and unfolds the

meaning of life.</p>

<p>These statements, beruft of any religious Import, Insinuation or alludement arnused u myvticl attraction to learn and to know more about its doctrinary philosophy and thereby better my knowledge and Self.</p>

<p>After joining, further involvement led to

study of The 12 Principles of Valid Action

and deeper study of the Triology :Inner

Look, The Internal Landscape and The

Human Landscape. These were discussed

in weekly meeting and the tone, Self

Uberation, was expounded in retreats

What really got me into the work was

the complete selflessness,

opened and meaningfulness of

people who taught us. </p>

<p>It is now over 40 years with the Movement.For major part of it, at least for the last 3 years, another Argentinian, Fernando Garcia, ariented the process of Humanist Movement in India, along with my colleagues, learnt from him the core of Humanist Doctrine, and what it meant as an emotion or feeling and, consequently, as a Way of Life. Fernando teacher, an orlentor and a guide par excellence, who got engaged in spreading the message of Immunization, teaching others in groups, orienting and integrating people We learnt to campaign, publish and take stands against dehumanization</p>

<p>I count upon some of my colleagues

Jayesh Shah, Alyappa, Parimal

Merchant, Nailesh Dalal, Lokendra,

Suresh Melisa, Joet Menan, Rakesh

Doshi, Viren Shah, Vipul Mody, Atul

India, amongst several others whe

possessed tremendous team spirit</p>

<p>My brother Lokondra, kis son Chaitanya,

my daughter Nisha,my sons, the family

at my home town Latur allot

involved. Many of them are yet active

while others are supportive</p>

<p>Peak moments in Humanist Movement

were starting y first group, conducting

first retreat, starting several groups in

Latur, translating Sile in Hindi on the

same stage in 1981 in front of 12, 000

people at Chowpatty in Mumbai,

becoming an Energy Master, inspiration

received from Femando's hugely

detailed efforts for his book Humanism

in India, starting The school of Internal

Literacy (Oil), desiging Energy

practicing videos and ving first tul

fledged testimony in front of people

at Patkar Hall In sil those moments i felt happy and exuberant because either ner was giving, learning to prove or was expressing what i had experienced. </p>

<p>40 years perseverance is the measure of dedication in an individual life's era. It is a dedication of a major part of one's Life time. In an enlightening and dynamic environment ike The Humanist Movement, such a long Association and participation makes one learn, experience and develop an insight into significant aspects of life. As a result, one move from aimlessness of simple existential life to purposefulness and from disorientation to orientation and from non meaning to meaning of life,</p>

<p>For me, this has meant shift</p>

<p>from living a self-centred personal life

to one of openness,</p>

<p>from a field of simple routine

communication to purposeful

dialogues with people</p>

<p>and from a chatterful mind to a

reflective attitude towards what gives

meaning to the way i've.</p>

<p>Asi reflect my overall passage of life,

realize that assaciation with The

Humanist Movement has made my life

value-oriented, prioritized and more

reflective, It has made me conscious in

taking a stand in each situation about

how i can contribute rather than fou

victimized,</p>

<p>1 have realized that</p>

<p>a life that is so centred primarily in

receiving for oneself is an error.</p>

<p>an imbalance is created when things

are not made to move topether but are

kept in separatedness or Isolation.</p>

<p>life becomes meaningful and doors

to volution openly when you

rise above pettiness of a purely

personal life in order to also

contribute

in bettering the life of others.</p>

<p>Today, I realize that more than a

mundane lite, a meaningful life is tar

more important. A life of continuous

learning and balanced ving are

foundations of a coherent life. And

working to establish meaningful

connectivity a around with the aim of

contributing for a better world greatly

-serves the purpose of humanization.</p>

<p>To merely thank Sila for providing me

the chance to embrace something as

noble as The Humanist Movement in this

life is just not sufficient enough to

express my immense gratitude. This

gratitude can only be expressed when I

truly fulfill to my ability, the task of

humanising my world, the one I live in

or in other words my immediate

enviament comprising my family, my

workmates, my neighbours and friends.</p>

<p>And slowly, we embrace the task of

Humanizing the Earth!</p>
