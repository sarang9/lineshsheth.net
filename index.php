<p>Linesh sheth is spiritual seeker, a teacher of meditation, an unfailing meditator for over 30 years, a Breathing Specialist, an Energy Master and a Life Coach. By qualification, he is a Mechanical Engineering graduate.</p>

<p>As a way of life, he is a Humanist in his approach. He has been an active member of the Humanist movement for over last 3 decades, since 1976. The Humanist Movement is a current of thought based on concepts founded by the great <b>Argentinian philosopher and thinker, Silo.</b> That current of thought taught him to think in terms of placing human being a central value in life as against the values attached to money, success, and self-centered life. He lives with the concept that it is in the welfare of others that your own welfare is included.</p>

<p>While pursuing his career as a Specialist Tool engineer to establish a group of industries, a nagging question at the back of his mind that haunted him continuously was to seek the purpose and meaning of his life. He went on exchanging dialogue with people he worked with, about <i>their</i> purpose and meaning of life.</p>

<p>He was taught to become an Energy Master by The School founded by Silo. He realized through his daily energy elevation practices that Breath created a life force, the vital energy of life. That energy can be focused, circulated, spiralled and directed easily as one wishes. As a result energy centers in various parts of the body including brain get activated.</p> 

<p style="font-size:18px; text-align:center;"><b>"if you live, die or were not born at all, makes no difference to the world, your life has no meaning"</b></p>

<p>Inspired by humanism of Silo, he today works as a volunteer, mentor and an orientor for last 34 years to spread Silo's message of non-violence and meaning of life through various organizations like Humanist Movement and the <a href="http://www.humanistmovement.net" target="_blank">Community for Human Development</a>.</p>

<p>However, a common man had no knowledge of this very useful dimension of breath. It was a common Internal Illiteracy. To make this knowledge popular and available to all, free of any cost, he founded a virtual school called <b>School of Internal Literacy(SOIL)</b>. Breathing meditations of Soil are all available on YouTube under The School of Internal Literacy(SOIL).</p>

<p>His mentor, Silo, taught him to learn without limit. Inspired by this, he made <a href="http://www.silo.net" target="_blank">"learning without limit"</a> as his constant passion of life. Learning about life and its meaning became his search. As a result, he came across various masters from India, USA, China, Germany, Japan. He spent considerable time with them and their teachings. He learnt from them to synthesize great learnings into a sort of a principle or a tenet.</p>

<p>Mr. Linesh Sheth believes that he was able to accomplish multiple things in life mainly because of great support found from his family, friends, colleagues and mentors.</p>
